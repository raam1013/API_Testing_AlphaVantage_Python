I have tried the automate that AlphaVantage_Daily with my python minimol knowledge.
Here I have written the code for IBM_TIME_SERIES_60_Mins_DAILY flow.
I have add the params based on my requrement and hit the request
Then I got list of IBM_TIME_SERIES response flow
Those input and output I tried to generate in Allure Reports but unfartunately It shown only Test Case Name.
So I did the console output converted into one html output file.
-----------------------------------------------
Process:
Step_1:
->Create the Python pytest Project
->Then add all the required libraries
1.requests
2.alpha_vantage.timeseries
3.requests_toolbelt.utils
4.allure-pytest
5.allure-python-commons
6.json

Step_2:
->Download and set env variables and Create the Reports_Allure folder in Project

Step_3:
->Then create the multiple sets of functions and written code for IBM Symbol using request(URI+Payload+API KEY)
->Here I have taken attributes for Payloads are:
function= TIME_SERIES_INTRADAY
symbol= symbol
interval= 60min
datatype= json
apikey= H3RF2EQFQIC7O1R8

Step_4:
->Then execute the test_Request_04.py file for IBM request and Response(Here i tried with 1 min aslo but getting error)
pytest -v -s GET_Requests/test_Request_04.py --alluredir=Reports_Allure

Step_5:
->Then go to Project directiory and open cmd, paste the below command.
allure serve Reports_Allure
->Once allure report is ready then automatically that generated the allure report open in default browser(chrome)


TestCase_Name_In_Project:
pytest -v -s GET_Requests/test_Request_04.py --alluredir=Reports_Allure
allure serve Reports_Allure
-----------------------------------------------
API TestCases:
1. Provide the Valid URI and Payload
2. Provide the Invalid URI and Valid Payload
3. Provide the multiple set of Payloads
4. Provide the URI and Payloads without API Key
5. Provide the null data in Payloads
6. Provide the symbol(IBM) that is available in AlphaVantage_Daily API
7. Provide the symbol(UHG) that not is available in AlphaVantage_Daily API
8. Provide the interval is 60 Minutes in Daily
9. Provide the interval is 1 Minutes in Daily
10. Validate the Response in Json format
11. Validate the Response with all the required attributes
13. Validate the response time
14. Validate the all the headers
